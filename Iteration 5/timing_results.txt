Average Total Time: 1m26.071s
Average Number of events processed: 162
Average Time per elevator event = 86.071s/162 = 0.531s

Average Total time Confidence interval = 86.07125 +- 0.0393 (86.0319, 86.1106)
The confidence interval shows the values below are reasonable as they are within the range.

Instrumentation was added to display_and_floor.cpp, where the display and floor files are ran
at the same so the program can start tracking as soon as we run this file. The display file
logs all elevators states, so the total event count is tracked here from the 4 elevators running.
We run this program with the time command on linux to get the total time taken for all events to
process. The program stops running once all events are processed, which happens after all the 
elevators turn to IDLE/SHUTDOWN state 7 times (multiple times since the input file intentionally
puts breaks in elevators running). The average time for an event to run is derived from the 
total time / # of events.
